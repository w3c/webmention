        Webmention is a simple way to notify any URL when you link to it on your site. From the receiver's perspective, it's a way to request notifications when other sites link to it.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>At a basic level, a webmention is a notification that one URL links
      to another.</p>

      <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]].</p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>A typical Webmention flow is as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>Alice posts some interesting content on her site (which is set up to receive webmentions).</li>
            <li>Bob sees this content and comments about it on his site, linking back to Alice's original post.</li>
            <li>Using Webmention, Bob's publishing software automatically notifies Alice's server that her post has been linked to by the URL of Bob's post.</li>
            <li>Alice's publishing software verifies that Bob's post actually contains a link to her post and then includes this information on her site.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Protocol Summary</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>User Aaron posts a blog post on his blog</li>
          <li>User Barnaby writes post on his blog that links to Aaron's post.</li>
          <li>After publishing the post (i.e. it has a URL), Barnaby's server notices this link as part of the publishing process</li>
          <li>Barnaby's server does webmention discovery on Aaron's post to find its webmention endpoint (if not found, process stops)</li>
          <li>Barnaby's server sends a webmention to Aaron's post's webmention endpoint with
            <ul>
              <li><code>source</code> set to Barnaby's post's permalink</li>
              <li><code>target</code> set to Aaron's post's permalink.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Aaron's server receives the webmention</li>
          <li>Aaron's server verifies that <code>target</code> in the webmention is a valid permalink on Aaron's blog (if not, processing stops)</li>
          <li>Aaron's server verifies that the <code>source</code> (when retrieved, after following redirects [[!FETCH]]) in the webmention contains a hyperlink to the <code>target</code> (if not, processing stops)</li>

      <h2>Webmention Protocol</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Sending Webmentions</h3>

        <section>
          <h4>Sender discovers receiver webmention endpoint</h4>

          <p>The sender MUST fetch the target URL and check for an HTTP Link header [[!RFC5988]]
            with <code>rel="webmention"</code>, or a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> or
            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element with <code>rel="webmention"</code>. If more than
            one of these is present, the first HTTP Link header takes precedence,
            followed by the first <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element, and finally
            the first <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element. Clients MUST support all
            three options and fall back in this order.</p>

          <p>The endpoint MAY be a relative
            URL, in which case the sender MUST resolve it relative to the
            <code>target</code> URL according to the [[!URL]] specification.</p>

          <p>Senders MAY initially make an HTTP HEAD request [[!RFC2616]] to
            check for the Link header before making a GET request.</p>

          <p>This specification uses the link rel registry as defined by [[!HTML5]]
            for both HTML and HTTP link relations.</p>

          <p><pre class="example">GET /post-by-aaron HTTP/1.1
Host: aaronpk.example
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Link: &lt;http://aaronpk.example/webmention-endpoint&gt;; rel="webmention"

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
...
&lt;link href="http://aaronpk.example/webmention-endpoint" rel="webmention" /&gt;
...
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
....
&lt;a href="http://aaronpk.example/webmention-endpoint" rel="webmention"&gt;webmention&lt;/a&gt;
...
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Sender notifies receiver</h4>

          <p>The sender MUST post x-www-form-urlencoded [[!HTML5]] <code>source</code> and
            <code>target</code> parameters to the webmention endpoint, where
            <code>source</code> is the URL of the sender's page containing a link,
            and <code>target</code> is the URL of the page being linked to.</p>

          <p>The webmention endpoint will validate and process the request, and
            return an HTTP status code [[!RFC2616]]. Most often, <code>202 Accepted</code>
            or <code>201 Created</code> will be returned, indicating that the
            request is queued and being processed asynchronously to prevent
            DoS attacks. If the response code is 201, the <code>Location</code>
            header will include a URL that can be used to monitor the
            status of the request.</p>

          <p>Any <code>2xx</code> response code MUST be considered a success.</p>

          <p><pre class="example">POST /webmention-endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: aaronpk.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

source=https://waterpigs.example/post-by-barnaby&amp;
target=https://aaronpk.example/post-by-aaron


HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted</pre></p>

        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Receiving Webmentions</h3>

        <p>Upon receipt of a POST request containing the <code>source</code> and
          <code>target</code> parameters, the receiver SHOULD queue and process
          the request asynchronously to prevent DoS attacks. There are three
          possible responses to the request, depending on how the receiver
          processes it.</p>

        <p>If the receiver creates a status page which the sender can use to
          check the status, the receiver MUST reply with an <code>HTTP 201 Created</code>
          response with a <code>Location</code> header pointing to the status
          URL. The response body MAY contain content, in which case a human
          readable response is recommended.</p>

        <p><pre class="example">HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://aaronpk.example/webmention/DEhB9Jme
Content-type: text/plain

The webmention is being processed. You can check on its status here: http://aaronpk.example/webmention/DEhB9Jme</pre></p>

        <p>If the receiver processes the request asynchronously but does not
          return a status URL, the receiver MUST reply with an <code>HTTP 202 Accepted</code>
          response. The response body MAY contain content, in which case a
          human readable response is recommended.</p>

        <p><pre class="example">HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-type: text/plain

The webmention is being processed</pre></p>

        <p>If the receiver chooses to process the request and perform the
          verification step synchronously (not recommended), it MUST respond
          with a <code>200 OK</code> status on success.</p>

        <section>
          <h4>Request Verification</h4>

          <p>The receiver MUST check that source and target are valid URLs [[!URL]]
            and are of schemes that are supported by the receiver. (Most
            commonly this means checking that the source and target
            schemes are http or https).</p>

          <p>The receiver SHOULD check that target is a valid resource that it
            can accept webmentions for. This check SHOULD happen
            synchronously to reject invalid webmentions before more in-depth
            verification begins.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Webmention Verification</h4>

          <p>Webmention verification SHOULD be handled asynchronously to
            prevent DoS attacks.</p>

          <p>If the receiver is going to use the webmention in some way,
            (displaying it as a comment on a post, incrementing a "like"
            counter, notifying the author of a post), then it MUST perform an
            HTTP GET request on source, and follow any HTTP redirects
            (up to a self-imposed limit such as 20) to confirm that it actually
            links to target.</p>

          <p>The receiver SHOULD use per-media-type rules to determine whether
            the source document links to the target URL. For example, in an
            [[HTML5]] document, the receiver should look for <code>&lt;a href="*"&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;img href="*"&gt;</code>, <codE>&lt;video src="*"&gt;</code>
            and other similar links. In a [[JSON]] document, the receiver should
            look for properties whose values are an exact match for the URL.
            If the document is plain text, the receiver should look for the URL
            by searching for the string. Other content types may be handled at
            the implementer's discretion. The source document MUST have an exact
            match of the target URL provided in order for it to be considered a
            valid link.</p>

          <p>At this point, the receiver MAY publish content from this webmention
            on the target page or other pages, along with any other data it picks
            up from the source. For example, the receiver may display the
            contents of the source as a comment on the post.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Error Responses</h4>

          <p>If the webmention was not successful because of something the
            <i>sender</i> did, it MUST return a <code>400 Bad Request</code>
            status code and MAY include a description of the error in the response body.</p>

          <p>Possible sender-related errors that can be returned synchronously
            before making a GET request to the source:

            <ul>
              <li>Specified <code>target</code> URL not found.</li>
              <li>Specified <code>target</code> URL does not accept webmentions.</li>
              <li><code>source</code> URL was malformed or is not a supported URL scheme (e.g. a mailto: link)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>Possible sender-related errors that can occur after fetching the
            contents of the source URL:

            <ul>
              <li><code>source</code> URL not found.</li>
              <li><code>source</code> URL does not contain a link to the <code>target</code> URL.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>If the webmention was not successful because of an error on
            the receiver's server, it SHOULD return a <code>500 Internal Server Error</code>
            status code and MAY include a description of the error in the response body.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Updating existing webmentions</h4>

          <p>If receiver had received a webmention in the past with the same
            <code>source</code> and <code>target</code> then,

            <ul>
              <li>
                If both the verification steps are successful, it SHOULD update any existing data it picked from <code>source</code> for the existing webmention.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    When a webmention implementation does support updating (AKA a "webmention update implementation"), MUST support updating data from properties of the primary object of the source (e.g. properties of the h-entry of the page).
                    <ul>
                      <li>A webmention update implementation MAY support updating data from the h-entry of the page. If an implementation does support this, it MUST support it according to the [[!microformats2-parsing]] and [[!h-entry]] specifications.</li>
                      <li>
                        A webmention update implementation MAY support updating data from children, or other descendant objects of the primary object (e.g. a comment h-entry inside the h-entry of the page). If an implementation does support this, it MUST support it according to the [[!Salmention]] extension specification (AKA a "Salmention implementation").
                        <ul>
                          <li>A Salmention implementation MAY support updating data from children of the h-entry of the page. If an implementation does support this, it MUST support it according to the [[!microformats2-parsing]] and [[!h-entry]] specifications.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>If it received a <code>410 Gone</code> status code on step 2 (performing a GET request on source), or received a <code>200 OK</code> status code and does not find a link to <code>target</code> on <code>source</code>, it SHOULD delete the existing webmention.</li>
              <li>Processing webmentions SHOULD be idempotent. For example, receiving multiple webmentions for the same <code>source</code> and <code>target</code> with no content changes should not show as multiple replies.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        <h3>Preventing Abuse</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>The verification process SHOULD be queued and processed asynchronously to prevent DoS attacks.</li>
          <li>Receivers SHOULD moderate or otherwise verify webmentions before displaying them.</li>
          <li>Receivers MAY periodically re-verify webmentions and update them.</li>
          <li>If a receiver chooses to publish data it picks up from source, it should ensure that the data is encoded and/or filtered to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Limits on GET requests</h3>
        <p>The Webmention protocol relies on the sender making a GET (or HEAD)
          request to discover the receiver's endpoint, followed by the receiver
          making a GET request to the sender's web page to verify the link.
          This means a sender can cause a receiver to make GET requests to
          arbitrary URLs, opening up a potential DoS vector.</p>
        <p>Receivers SHOULD place limits on the amount of data and time they
          spend fetching unverified source URLs. For example, if a source URL
          doesn't respond within 5 seconds, it can treat that as a failure.
          Similarly, the receiver can fetch only the first 1mb of the page,
          since any reasonably HTML or JSON page will be smaller than that.</p>

        allows clients that mention a resource in some form of publishing
        process to contact that endpoint and inform it that this resource has
        been mentioned.</dd>
        
        <dt>Reference:</dt>
        <dd><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">W3C WebMention
        Specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/)</a></dd>
        
        <dt>Notes:</dt>
        <dd>This is a similar "Linkback" mechanism to the ones of Refback,
        Trackback, and Pingback. It uses a different protocol, though, and thus
        should be discoverable through its own link relation type.</dd>
